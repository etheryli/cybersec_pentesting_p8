# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: __________________

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Green

# Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration
* The login page returns a bolded text "Log in was unsuccessful" for existing username (ie. jmonroe99), but normal text for any other usernames, with any random passwords for both kinds of users. Red and Blue sites always return bolded text. An attacker can simply bruteforce to enumerate a list of users.

# Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Red

# Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference 
- Simply change the number of the id in the URL
- ID 10 and 11 are employees not shown on the "Find a Salesperson" page, and they are not supposed to be accessible indicated by the comments next to their names.
- Blue and Green sites check access control and redirect the page to the main directory page again.
